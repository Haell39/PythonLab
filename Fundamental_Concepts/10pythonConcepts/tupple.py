'''
Once created, you cannot modify a tuple (no adding, removing, or changing items).
This makes tuples useful for storing fixed data.

#my_tupple[0] = 5  # This will raise a TypeError

# Packing and Unpacking

print(name)
print(profession)

# Tuple common operations

Length: len(my_tuple)
Concatenation: my_tuple + another_tuple
Repetition: my_tuple * 3
Membership: 'a' in my_tuple

# Tuples as keys in dictionaries

location = {(40.7128, -74.0060): "New York City"}

Summary of Key Points:

Immutable: Tuples cannot be changed after creation.
Ordered: Tuples maintain the order of elements.
Packing/Unpacking: Efficient ways to group or distribute values.
Useful in Function Returns: Great for returning multiple values.
Tuples are a powerful tool in Python, especially when working with data that should remain constant. Let me know if youâ€™d like more examples!
