Hashmaps (or dictionaries in Python) are one of the most powerful and commonly used data structures in programming. They allow you to store and retrieve data efficiently using key-value pairs. Since you're a beginner, I'll make this tutorial practical and easy to follow. Let's break it down step by step, from beginner to advanced.

---

### **Crash Course: Hashmaps in Python**

---

### **1. What is a Hashmap?**
A hashmap (or dictionary in Python) is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key is unique, and it maps to a specific value. Think of it like a real-life dictionary: you look up a word (key) and find its definition (value).

- **Key**: Unique identifier (e.g., a string, number, or tuple).
- **Value**: Data associated with the key (e.g., a string, number, list, or even another dictionary).

---

### **2. Why Use Hashmaps?**
- **Fast Lookups**: Hashmaps allow you to retrieve values in constant time (`O(1)`), on average.
- **Flexible**: You can store any type of data as values.
- **Common Use Cases**: Counting occurrences, caching, storing configurations, etc.

### **3. Basics of Python Dictionaries (Hashmaps)**

#### **Creating a Dictionary**
```python
# Empty dictionary
my_dict = {}

# Dictionary with key-value pairs
person = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 25,
    "city": "New York"
}
```

#### **Accessing Values**
```python
print(person["name"])  # Output: Alice
print(person.get("age"))  # Output: 25
```

#### **Adding/Updating Values**
```python
person["age"] = 26  # Update age
person["job"] = "Engineer"  # Add new key-value pair
```

#### **Deleting Values**
```python
del person["city"]  # Remove key-value pair
person.pop("age")  # Remove and return the value
```

#### **Checking if a Key Exists**
```python
if "name" in person:
    print("Name exists!")
```

#### **Iterating Over a Dictionary**
```python
for key, value in person.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")
```

### **4. Practical Examples**

#### **Example 1: Counting Word Frequencies**
```python
text = "apple banana apple orange banana apple"
words = text.split()

word_count = {}
for word in words:
    if word in word_count:
        word_count[word] += 1
    else:
        word_count[word] = 1

print(word_count)
# Output: {'apple': 3, 'banana': 2, 'orange': 1}
```

#### **Example 2: Storing User Information**
```python
users = {
    "alice": {"age": 25, "email": "alice@example.com"},
    "bob": {"age": 30, "email": "bob@example.com"}
}

# Accessing nested data
print(users["alice"]["email"])  # Output: alice@example.com
```

---

### **5. Advanced Concepts**

#### **Defaultdict**
`defaultdict` from the `collections` module allows you to specify a default value for keys that don't exist.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

word_count = defaultdict(int)  # Default value is 0
text = "apple banana apple orange banana apple"
words = text.split()

for word in words:
    word_count[word] += 1

print(word_count)
# Output: defaultdict(<class 'int'>, {'apple': 3, 'banana': 2, 'orange': 1})
```

#### **Counter**
`Counter` from the `collections` module is a specialized dictionary for counting occurrences.

```python
from collections import Counter

text = "apple banana apple orange banana apple"
word_count = Counter(text.split())

print(word_count)
# Output: Counter({'apple': 3, 'banana': 2, 'orange': 1})
```

#### **Dictionary Comprehensions**
Create dictionaries in a concise way.

```python
squares = {x: x**2 for x in range(1, 6)}
print(squares)
# Output: {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}
```

#### **Merging Dictionaries**
```python
dict1 = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
dict2 = {"b": 3, "c": 4}

merged = {**dict1, **dict2}  # Python 3.5+
print(merged)
# Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}
```

### **6. Common Pitfalls**
- **KeyError**: Accessing a key that doesn't exist. Use `.get()` to avoid this.
- **Mutable Keys**: Only immutable types (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples) can be used as keys.
- **Order**: Before Python 3.7, dictionaries did not maintain insertion order. Now they do.

### **7. Practice Problems**

#### **Problem 1: Find the Most Frequent Element**
Given a list of numbers, find the most frequent element.

```python
numbers = [1, 3, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1]
# Your code here
```

#### **Problem 2: Group Anagrams**
Given a list of words, group words that are anagrams of each other.

```python
words = ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]
# Your code here
```

#### **Problem 3: Two Sum**
Given a list of numbers and a target, find two numbers that add up to the target.

```python
numbers = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
# Your code here
```

---

### **8. Solutions to Practice Problems**

#### **Solution 1: Most Frequent Element**
```python
from collections import Counter

numbers = [1, 3, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1]
count = Counter(numbers)
most_frequent = count.most_common(1)[0][0]
print(most_frequent)  # Output: 1
```

#### **Solution 2: Group Anagrams**
```python
from collections import defaultdict

words = ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]
anagrams = defaultdict(list)

for word in words:
    sorted_word = "".join(sorted(word))
    anagrams[sorted_word].append(word)

print(list(anagrams.values()))
# Output: [['eat', 'tea', 'ate'], ['tan', 'nat'], ['bat']]
```

#### **Solution 3: Two Sum**
```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

numbers = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
print(two_sum(numbers, target))  # Output: [0, 1]
```
