"""
This code will print a triangle of asterisks (*) from 0 to 5 lines.
Here is how it works:
- The for loop iterates over the range from 0 to 5 (6 elements).
- For each iteration, the expression '*'*i is evaluated.
- The expression '*'*i will repeat the string '*' i times.
- The result of the expression is then printed.
- The result is a triangle of asterisks, with 0 asterisks on the first line, 1 asterisk on the second line, 2 asterisks on the third line, and so on.

for i in range(0, 6):
    print('*'*i) # This is like '*' multiplied by i, and i is increasing by 1 each time. so we have '*' on the first line, '**' on the second line, and so on.

# Output:
# (empty line)
